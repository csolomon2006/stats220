I was curious about what the most common coffee orders were, which coffee takes the longest to make, and the coffee that gets the most extra items ordered. The graphs below show interesting information about peoples coffee orders.  



## This graph shows the most ordered coffees

We can see that the latte was the most ordered coffee with there being 8 orders, whilst the least ordered coffees were the Iced Latte and the Macchiato.
